Hi, I'm going to use [nami][nami] which is one of the man characters in [One Piece][one-piece].

Lets make a first program. I use python3, I actually don't care use python or phthon 3 though.

1. Create a directory for example codes.
2. Create a file with `.py` extension. (helloName.py)
```python
print("Hello Nami!")
```

3. Run this program.
```bash
nami@CloudLMX ~/PE $ python3 helloNami.py
Hello Nami!
nami@CloudLMX ~/PE $
```

That's simple as. Simple is beautiful.

I'll update this post and add more.
