Hi,
I'd like to write about numbers in python today.

Python supports integers, floats, and complex.

  ```python
  berry = 100

  type_of_berry = type(berry)

  print(berry, ' is ', type_of_berry)
  # 100  is  <class 'int'>
  ```

  ```python
  wt = 121.254

  type_of_wt = type(wt)

  print(wt, ' is ', type_of_wt)
  # 121.254  is  <class 'float'>
  ```

  ```python
  no_where = 2 + 3j

  type_of_no_where = type(no_where)

  print(no_where, ' is ' , type_of_no_where)
  # (2+3j)  is  <class 'complex'>
  ```




Cheers :beers:
