Hi,
I've been busy to to my personal things recently.
So, I'm gonna tell one, very simple thing today.
`input()`

`input()` allows us to display a prompt on the console, and get a string from that users can type on the console.

example:

  ```python
  >>> name = input("Who are you? ")
  Who are you? nami
  >>> print('Hi', name)
  Hi nami
  ```
It's very simple.

Cheers :beers:
