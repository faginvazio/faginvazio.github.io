Hi,
I'm going to say about modules in python today.

To organise python codes, we can use a module.
A module is a python file which has functions, classes, or variables.
To use a module in your python code, you can import it by the `import` statement.


  ```Python
  import module

  ```

To use a specific attribute from a module, you can use `from ... import` statement.

  ```Python
  from module import attribute
  from module2 import *  ## import all attributes


  ```

It's very simple.

Cheers :beers:
